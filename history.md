**History of DevOps**

The man who got credit for 'inventing' Devops is Patrick Debois. Patrick was interested in learning IT from every perspective, and in 2007, he began working on a large data center migration where he was in charge of testing. During this project, he realized that the frustrations experienced in projects such as these are from the constant switching back and forth between the development side of the problem and the silo of operations on the other side. He recognized that a lot of time and effort was wasted navigating the project between these two worlds, but the divide between them seemed too wide to bridge.

Initially, the interest was pretty low and not a whole lot came of it. In June of 2009, John Allspaw and Paul Hammond gave a talk entitled “10+ Deploys a Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr.” Patrick happened to watch the streaming video of that presentation at his home in Belgium, and it instantly resonated with him. He eventually named the day DevOpsDay or DevOps for short
